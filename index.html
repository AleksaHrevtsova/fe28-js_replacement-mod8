                        the doors, the dormer windows, the roofs, gazing at the palace, gazing at the populace, 
                        and asking nothing more; for many Parisians content themselves with the spectacle of the 
                        spectators, and a wall behind which something is going on becomes at once, for us, a very 
                        curious thing indeed.</p>

                        into that immense hall of the palace, which was so cramped on that sixth of January, 1482, 
                        \the spectacle would not be devoid of either interest or charm, and we should have about 
                        us only things that were so old that they would seem new.</p>
